This repository provides a temnplate for a full stack solution for a Java spring boot API with a react based front-end.

## Details for the Spring Boot API
A simple spring boot based REST API that can CRUD's data for accounts for customers.

### API structure
1.  a basic CRUD API for a resource i.e. account
    - maintain a simple structure without relying too much on certain design patterns
    - saves data to a in-memory list
2. react based front-end that sends data back and forth
    - keep all logic in the one app.js file
    - don't worry about writing unit tests for rect based UI
3. postman tests to validate the Spring Boot API
    - ensure postman tests are checked in the source code
